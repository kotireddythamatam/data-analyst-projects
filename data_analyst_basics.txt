types of variables:
------------------
1. Categorical
2. Numerical

Categorical varibles:
--------------------
Varabiles which can be grouped based on it's category
ex: gender, marriage status, colors etc

Numerical variables:
--------------------
1. Descrete
2. Continuous

Descrete Variables:
-------------------
Variables which can be counted as integers.
ex: no.of childrens, no.of bugs etc.

Continuous Variables:
---------------------
Variables which can be counted as float numbers.
ex: weight, time etc.



Levels of data measurement:
---------------------------
1. Nominal
2. Ordinal
3. Interval
4. Ratio

Nominal Data:
-------------
Nominal data which can be distinct categories and no ranking implied. No arithematic operation.
ex: gender, marriage status, colors etc.

Ordinal Data:
------------
Ordinal data which can be distinct categories and ranking implied. No arithematic operation.
ex: customer satisfaction(good, average, poor, verypoor), Student grades etc

Interval Data:
-------------
Interval Data where difference between measurements is meaningfull quanity but don't have true zero point. Addition and substraction can be done
ex: temperature(at 0 temperature also some heat will be there)

Ratio Data:
----------
Ratio data where difference between measurements is meaningfull quantity and have true zero point. All arithematic operations can be done.
Ex: age, weight
